# Hormonal Imbalances

## Chapter Summary
Hormones are the body's chemical messengers. When they are out of balance, it can affect everything from mood to metabolism. This chapter explores common hormonal issues like thyroid disorders, cortisol dysregulation, and estrogen dominance.

## Medical Explanation: The Endocrine System
The endocrine system regulates hormones. Key players for women include estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, insulin, and thyroid hormones.

### Common Imbalances
1.  **Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Fatigue, weight gain, cold sensitivity, hair loss, dry skin.
    *   **Cause:** Often autoimmune (Hashimoto's).
2.  **Hyperthyroidism (Overactive Thyroid):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Anxiety, weight loss, rapid heartbeat, heat intolerance.
3.  **Estrogen Dominance:**
    *   **What it is:** High estrogen relative to progesterone.
    *   **Symptoms:** Heavy periods, fibroids, bloating, mood swings.
4.  **Cortisol Imbalance (Stress Hormone):**
    *   **Chronic Stress:** Leads to adrenal fatigue/dysfunction, affecting sleep and causing belly fat accumulation.
5.  **Insulin Resistance:**
    *   **Link:** Closely tied to PCOS. Cells don't respond to insulin, leading to high blood sugar and weight gain.

## Symptoms & Abnormalities
*   Irregular or absent periods.
*   Unexplained weight changes.
*   Acne (especially jawline/cystic).
*   Hair loss or unwanted hair growth (hirsutism).
*   Severe fatigue or insomnia.
*   Low libido.

## Diagnosis & Clinical Care
*   **Blood Panels:** TSH, T3, T4 (Thyroid); Cortisol (AM/PM); Insulin/Glucose; Sex hormones (Day 3 or Day 21 testing).
*   **Saliva/Urine Tests:** Sometimes used for cortisol patterns (DUTCH test).

## Management & Lifestyle
*   **Diet:**
    *   **Blood Sugar Balance:** Eat protein and healthy fats with every meal to stabilize insulin.
    *   **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Broccoli, kale, and cauliflower help metabolize excess estrogen.
*   **Stress Management:** High cortisol "steals" resources from sex hormone production. Meditation and sleep are medicinal.
*   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours. Hormones regulate and detoxify during sleep.
*   **Endocrine Disruptors:** Reduce exposure to plastics (BPA) and synthetic fragrances which can mimic estrogen.

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Medication:** Thyroid medication (Levothyroxine) must be taken on an empty stomach.
*   **Supplements:** Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin D, and Omega-3s support hormonal health (consult a doctor).
