# Sleep & Stress Science

## Chapter Summary
Sleep is when your body repairs itself and regulates hormones. This chapter explores the bidirectional relationship between stress, sleep, and your menstrual cycle, offering science-backed strategies for rest.

## Medical Explanation: The Sleep-Hormone Loop
*   **Cortisol:** The "awake" hormone. Should be high in the morning and low at night. Chronic stress keeps it high, preventing sleep.
*   **Melatonin:** The "sleep" hormone. Produced in darkness.
*   **Progesterone:** Has a sedative effect. When it drops before a period, insomnia is common.

## Stress Regulation
Chronic stress disrupts the HPA axis (Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal), leading to:
*   **Cycle Issues:** Delayed ovulation or missed periods.
*   **PMS:** Worsened symptoms.
*   **Weight Gain:** Especially around the abdomen.

## Sleep Hygiene Strategies
1.  **Circadian Rhythm:** Get sunlight in the morning and dim lights in the evening.
2.  **Temperature:** Keep the bedroom cool (around 65°F/18°C).
3.  **Tech Detox:** Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin. Avoid screens 1 hour before bed.
4.  **Caffeine Cutoff:** Avoid caffeine after 12-2 PM as it stays in your system for hours.

## Managing Cycle-Related Sleep Issues
*   **PMS Insomnia:** Try magnesium glycinate supplements or a warm bath before bed.
*   **Night Sweats:** Wear breathable cotton pajamas and keep a fan nearby.

## Diagnosis & Clinical Care
*   **Sleep Study:** If you snore loudly or gasp for air (Sleep Apnea).
*   **Therapy:** CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) is the gold standard for chronic sleep issues.

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Routine:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.
*   **Relaxation:** Box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) activates the parasympathetic nervous system.
