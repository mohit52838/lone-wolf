# Postpartum & Recovery

## Chapter Summary
The "fourth trimester" is a time of intense physical and emotional healing. This chapter guides you through the recovery process after birth, breastfeeding basics, and recognizing the signs of postpartum complications.

## Medical Explanation: The Fourth Trimester
The postpartum period generally lasts 6-8 weeks but full recovery can take months.

### Physical Changes
*   **Uterine Involution:** The uterus contracts to return to its pre-pregnancy size, causing "afterpains."
*   **Lochia:** Vaginal bleeding and discharge that lasts for weeks. It starts bright red, turns pink/brown, and then yellow/white.
*   **Perineal Healing:** Soreness or stitches if tearing or an episiotomy occurred.
*   **C-Section Recovery:** Incision care is vital. Avoid heavy lifting and driving until cleared.

## Breastfeeding Basics
*   **Colostrum:** The first milk, rich in antibodies ("liquid gold").
*   **Latch:** A good latch is key to preventing nipple pain and ensuring baby gets enough milk. The baby's mouth should cover the areola, not just the nipple.
*   **Supply:** Milk production is demand-driven. Frequent nursing signals the body to make more.
*   **Challenges:** Engorgement, mastitis (infection), and sore nipples are common. Seek a lactation consultant if needed.

## Emotional Health
*   **Baby Blues:** Affects ~80% of new moms. Mood swings, crying, and anxiety in the first 2 weeks. Resolves on its own.
*   **Postpartum Depression (PPD):** Intense sadness, hopelessness, or lack of bonding that persists beyond 2 weeks. Requires medical treatment.
*   **Postpartum Anxiety:** Excessive worry or panic attacks about the baby's safety.

## Warning Signs: When to Call a Doctor
*   **Heavy Bleeding:** Soaking a pad in an hour or passing large clots.
*   **Fever:** Signs of infection (uterine, breast, or incision).
*   **Severe Headache:** Could be postpartum preeclampsia.
*   **Leg Pain/Swelling:** Potential sign of a blood clot (DVT).
*   **Chest Pain/Shortness of Breath:** Emergency symptoms.

## Diagnosis & Clinical Care
*   **Postpartum Checkup:** Usually at 6 weeks to check healing, discuss contraception, and screen for depression.
*   **Mental Health Screening:** Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Rest:** "Sleep when the baby sleeps" is a cliché but true. Prioritize recovery over chores.
*   **Nutrition:** Continue prenatal vitamins. Stay hydrated, especially if breastfeeding.
*   **Pelvic Floor:** Kegel exercises (once cleared) help strengthen muscles weakened by pregnancy.
