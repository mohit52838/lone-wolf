## Chapter Summary
Misinformation about women's health is rampant, passed down through generations or spread via social media. These myths can lead to harmful practices, shame, and delayed medical care. This chapter uses science to debunk common myths.

## Menstruation Myths
<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 1:</strong> "Period blood is dirty/impure."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> Period blood is composed of blood, uterine tissue, and mucus lining. It is sterile (until it leaves the body) and is a sign of a healthy reproductive system. It contains no toxins.
</div>

<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 2:</strong> "You can't get pregnant during your period."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> While unlikely, it is <strong>possible</strong>. Sperm can survive inside the body for up to 5 days. If you have a short cycle and ovulate early (soon after your period ends), sperm from sex during your period could fertilize the egg.
</div>

<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 3:</strong> "You shouldn't exercise/wash your hair/cook during your period."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> There is no medical reason to avoid these activities. In fact, exercise can relieve cramps, and warm baths are soothing. Hygiene is especially important during menstruation.
</div>

<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 4:</strong> "Tampons take your virginity."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> Virginity is a social construct, usually defined by having sex. Using a tampon may stretch the hymen (a thin tissue), but the hymen can also stretch from sports or naturally over time. A tampon does not change your sexual status.
</div>

## Reproductive Health Myths
<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 5:</strong> "The Pill causes infertility."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> Fertility typically returns very quickly after stopping the pill. Long-term use does not affect future fertility.
</div>

<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 6:</strong> "You only need a Pap smear if you are sexually active."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> While HPV (sexually transmitted) is the main cause of cervical cancer, guidelines recommend screening starting at age 21 regardless of sexual history in some regions (though guidelines are evolving, check with your doctor).
</div>

<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 7:</strong> "IUDs are only for women who have had children."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> IUDs are safe and highly effective for teens and women who have never given birth.
</div>

## General Health Myths
<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 8:</strong> "Bras cause breast cancer."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> There is no scientific evidence linking bra wearing (including underwire bras) to breast cancer risk [American Cancer Society].
</div>

<div class="myth-box">
  <strong>Myth 9:</strong> "You should douche to clean the vagina."
</div>
<div class="fact-box">
  <strong>Fact:</strong> The vagina is self-cleaning. Douching disrupts the natural bacterial balance (flora), increasing the risk of yeast infections and Bacterial Vaginosis (BV).
