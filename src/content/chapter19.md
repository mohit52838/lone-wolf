# Myths, Superstitions & Facts

## Chapter Summary
Misinformation about women's health is rampant, passed down through generations or spread via social media. These myths can lead to harmful practices, shame, and delayed medical care. This chapter uses science to debunk common myths.

## Menstruation Myths
### Myth 1: "Period blood is dirty/impure."
*   **Fact:** Period blood is composed of blood, uterine tissue, and mucus lining. It is sterile (until it leaves the body) and is a sign of a healthy reproductive system. It contains no toxins.

### Myth 2: "You can't get pregnant during your period."
*   **Fact:** While unlikely, it is **possible**. Sperm can survive inside the body for up to 5 days. If you have a short cycle and ovulate early (soon after your period ends), sperm from sex during your period could fertilize the egg.

### Myth 3: "You shouldn't exercise/wash your hair/cook during your period."
*   **Fact:** There is no medical reason to avoid these activities. In fact, exercise can relieve cramps, and warm baths are soothing. Hygiene is especially important during menstruation.

### Myth 4: "Tampons take your virginity."
*   **Fact:** Virginity is a social construct, usually defined by having sex. Using a tampon may stretch the hymen (a thin tissue), but the hymen can also stretch from sports or naturally over time. A tampon does not change your sexual status.

## Reproductive Health Myths
### Myth 5: "The Pill causes infertility."
*   **Fact:** Fertility typically returns very quickly after stopping the pill. Long-term use does not affect future fertility.

### Myth 6: "You only need a Pap smear if you are sexually active."
*   **Fact:** While HPV (sexually transmitted) is the main cause of cervical cancer, guidelines recommend screening starting at age 21 regardless of sexual history in some regions (though guidelines are evolving, check with your doctor).

### Myth 7: "IUDs are only for women who have had children."
*   **Fact:** IUDs are safe and highly effective for teens and women who have never given birth.

## General Health Myths
### Myth 8: "Bras cause breast cancer."
*   **Fact:** There is no scientific evidence linking bra wearing (including underwire bras) to breast cancer risk [American Cancer Society].

### Myth 9: "You should douche to clean the vagina."
*   **Fact:** The vagina is self-cleaning. Douching disrupts the natural bacterial balance (flora), increasing the risk of yeast infections and Bacterial Vaginosis (BV).
