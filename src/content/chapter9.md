# Fertility & Trying to Conceive (TTC)

## Chapter Summary
Understanding fertility is empowering whether you are planning a pregnancy now or in the future. This chapter breaks down the science of conception, how to identify your fertile window, and lifestyle factors that influence reproductive health. It also addresses common fertility challenges and when to seek medical advice.

## Medical Explanation: The Science of Conception
Conception requires a complex orchestration of events: ovulation, fertilization, and implantation.

### Key Concepts
1.  **The Fertile Window:**
    *   **What it is:** The 6-day period ending on the day of ovulation. Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 5 days, while the egg survives for only 12-24 hours after release.
    *   **Best timing:** Intercourse every 1-2 days during this window maximizes chances of conception.
2.  **Ovarian Reserve (AMH):**
    *   **Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH):** A blood test that estimates the remaining egg count. While it indicates quantity, it does not predict the *quality* of eggs or the ability to conceive naturally.
3.  **Egg Quality:**
    *   Declines with age, particularly after 35. Quality is crucial for fertilization and healthy embryo development.

## Tracking Ovulation
Identifying when you ovulate is the single most important step in TTC.

*   **Basal Body Temperature (BBT):** Your resting body temperature rises slightly (0.5–1°F) *after* ovulation due to progesterone. Good for confirming ovulation happened, but not for predicting it in advance.
*   **Cervical Mucus:** Look for "egg white" consistency—clear, stretchy, and slippery. This mucus helps sperm swim to the egg.
*   **Ovulation Predictor Kits (OPKs):** Urine tests that detect the surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which triggers ovulation 24-36 hours later.

## Lifestyle & Fertility
Small changes can have a significant impact on fertility for both partners.

*   **Weight:** Being significantly underweight or overweight can disrupt hormonal balance and stop ovulation.
*   **Smoking & Alcohol:** Smoking accelerates egg loss and ages the ovaries. Excessive alcohol can lower fertility rates.
*   **Stress:** Chronic stress can delay the hypothalamus from triggering ovulation.
*   **Male Factor:** Sperm health matters. Men should avoid excessive heat (saunas, tight underwear), smoking, and heavy drinking.

## When to See a Specialist
*   **Under 35:** If you haven't conceived after 1 year of regular unprotected intercourse.
*   **Over 35:** After 6 months of trying.
*   **Over 40:** Consult a specialist immediately or after 3 months.
*   **Irregular Cycles:** If periods are absent or very irregular, seek help sooner as you may not be ovulating.

## Diagnosis & Clinical Care
*   **Hormone Panel:** FSH, LH, Estradiol, Progesterone, Prolactin, TSH, and AMH.
*   **Hysterosalpingogram (HSG):** An X-ray test to check if fallopian tubes are open and the uterus shape is normal.
*   **Semen Analysis:** Checks sperm count, motility (movement), and morphology (shape).

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Prenatal Vitamins:** Start taking folic acid (400mcg) at least 1 month *before* trying to conceive to prevent neural tube defects.
*   **Lubricants:** Use fertility-friendly lubricants (e.g., Pre-Seed) as regular ones can hinder sperm movement.
