# Skin & Hair Health (Hormone Linked)

## Chapter Summary
Your skin and hair are external reflections of your internal hormonal health. This chapter decodes hormonal acne, hair loss patterns, and how to care for your skin throughout your cycle.

## Medical Explanation: The Skin-Hormone Connection
*   **Androgens (Testosterone):** Stimulate oil (sebum) production. Excess leads to acne.
*   **Estrogen:** Promotes collagen production, hydration, and hair growth.
*   **Progesterone:** Can increase sebum production in the luteal phase.

## Hormonal Acne
*   **Pattern:** Typically cystic (deep, painful bumps) along the jawline, chin, and neck.
*   **Timing:** often flares up just before menstruation (PMS).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Topical:** Salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or retinoids.
    *   **Internal:** Managing blood sugar (insulin spikes trigger oil), spearmint tea (anti-androgen).

## Hair Health
*   **Hair Fall (Telogen Effluvium):** Sudden shedding often triggered by stress, illness, or postpartum hormone drops. Usually temporary.
*   **Androgenic Alopecia (PCOS):** Thinning at the crown or male-pattern baldness due to high androgens.
*   **Hirsutism:** Growth of dark, coarse hair on the face, chest, or back (common in PCOS).

## Skin Cycling
Adjusting skincare to your cycle.
*   **Follicular/Ovulation:** Skin is glowing and resilient. Good time for active treatments (exfoliation, facials).
*   **Luteal/Menstrual:** Skin is more sensitive and oily. Focus on gentle cleansing, hydration, and spot treatment.

## Diagnosis & Clinical Care
*   **Dermatologist:** For persistent acne or hair loss.
*   **Endocrinologist:** If skin issues are accompanied by irregular periods (to check for PCOS).

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Sun Protection:** SPF is the #1 anti-aging product. Hormones can make skin more prone to pigmentation (melasma).
*   **Gentle Care:** Avoid harsh scrubbing which inflames acne.
*   **Clean Makeup:** Remove makeup every night to prevent clogged pores.
