# Pregnancy Basics & Early Pregnancy Health

## Chapter Summary
Pregnancy is a transformative journey. This chapter covers the essentials of the first trimester, recognizing early signs, understanding warning symptoms, and maintaining optimal health through nutrition and care.

## Medical Explanation: The Trimesters
Pregnancy typically lasts 40 weeks, divided into three trimesters.

### First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)
*   **Development:** The most critical period for fetal development. The heart, brain, and spinal cord begin to form.
*   **Maternal Changes:** Fatigue, nausea (morning sickness), breast tenderness, and frequent urination are common due to surging hormones (hCG, progesterone).

### Second Trimester (Weeks 13-26)
*   **Development:** The baby grows rapidly, movement can be felt ("quickening"), and sex can often be determined.
*   **Maternal Changes:** Nausea often subsides, energy returns. The "baby bump" becomes visible.

### Third Trimester (Weeks 27-40)
*   **Development:** The baby gains weight, lungs mature, and positions for birth.
*   **Maternal Changes:** Back pain, swelling, shortness of breath, and Braxton Hicks contractions.

## Early Signs of Pregnancy
*   Missed period.
*   Nausea or vomiting.
*   Breast swelling and tenderness.
*   Fatigue.
*   Frequent urination.
*   Food aversions or cravings.

## Nutrition & Supplements
*   **Folic Acid:** Crucial for preventing neural tube defects.
*   **Iron:** Supports increased blood volume and prevents anemia.
*   **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Essential for baby's bone growth.
*   **Avoid:** Raw meat/fish (sushi), unpasteurized dairy, high-mercury fish, alcohol, and smoking. Limit caffeine to <200mg/day.

## Warning Signs: When to Call a Doctor
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:
*   **Bleeding:** Heavy bleeding or spotting accompanied by pain.
*   **Severe Abdominal Pain:** Could indicate ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage.
*   **Severe Headache/Vision Changes:** Potential signs of preeclampsia (high blood pressure).
*   **Fever:** Over 100.4°F (38°C).
*   **Persistent Vomiting:** Inability to keep fluids down (Hyperemesis Gravidarum).

## Diagnosis & Clinical Care
*   **Confirmation:** Urine pregnancy test (hCG) followed by a blood test or ultrasound.
*   **Prenatal Visits:** Monthly check-ups initially, becoming more frequent closer to due date.
*   **Screening:** Genetic screening (NIPT), anatomy scan ultrasound (20 weeks), glucose tolerance test (24-28 weeks).

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to support increased blood volume.
*   **Rest:** Listen to your body and sleep when needed.
*   **Exercise:** Moderate activity like walking or swimming is generally safe and beneficial, but consult your doctor first.
