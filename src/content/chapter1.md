# Menstrual Cycle & Menstrual Health

## Chapter Summary
The menstrual cycle is a vital sign of overall health, not just a reproductive function. This chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes, hygiene practices, and indicators of health versus illness. Understanding your cycle empowers you to detect abnormalities early and manage your well-being effectively.

## Medical Explanation: The Biology
The menstrual cycle is a complex feedback loop involving the brain (hypothalamus and pituitary gland), ovaries, and uterus. It prepares the body for potential pregnancy each month.

### The Four Phases
1.  **Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):**
    *   **What happens:** If the egg from the previous cycle isn't fertilized, hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) drop. The thickened uterine lining (endometrium) sheds through the vagina.
    *   **Physical signs:** Bleeding, cramping, fatigue, lower back pain.
2.  **Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):**
    *   **What happens:** The pituitary gland releases Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), stimulating the ovaries to produce follicles. One dominant follicle matures into an egg. Estrogen levels rise to thicken the uterine lining again.
    *   **Physical signs:** Increased energy, clearer skin.
3.  **Ovulation Phase (Day 14):**
    *   **What happens:** A surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) causes the ovary to release the mature egg. This is the fertile window.
    *   **Physical signs:** Slight rise in basal body temperature, "egg white" cervical mucus, increased libido, sometimes mild pelvic pain (mittelschmerz).
4.  **Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):**
    *   **What happens:** The empty follicle becomes the corpus luteum, producing progesterone. This hormone stabilizes the uterine lining. If pregnancy doesn't occur, the corpus luteum disintegrates, hormones drop, and the cycle restarts.
    *   **Physical signs:** PMS symptoms (bloating, mood swings, breast tenderness).

> **Quick Tip:** A "normal" cycle can range from 21 to 35 days. Consistency is key. If your cycle varies by more than 7-9 days between months, consult a doctor.

## Menstrual Hygiene Management
Proper hygiene prevents Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs).

*   **Sanitary Pads:** Change every 4-6 hours to prevent bacterial growth and odor.
*   **Tampons:** Change every 4-8 hours. **Warning:** Leaving a tampon in for >8 hours increases the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), a rare but life-threatening bacterial infection.
*   **Menstrual Cups:** Made of medical-grade silicone. Sterilize in boiling water before each cycle. Wash with mild soap and water every 8-12 hours during use.
*   **Washing:** Wash the external genital area (vulva) with plain water. **Avoid douching** (washing inside the vagina), as it disrupts the natural pH balance and increases infection risk [ACOG, 2022].

## Symptoms & Abnormalities
When to see a doctor:
*   **Menorrhagia (Heavy Bleeding):** Soaking through one or more pads/tampons every hour for several hours.
*   **Dysmenorrhea (Severe Pain):** Cramps that do not improve with over-the-counter pain relief or disrupt daily life.
*   **Amenorrhea (Missed Periods):** Absence of menstruation for 3+ months (if not pregnant or menopausal).
*   **Spotting:** Bleeding between periods or after sex.

## Diagnosis & Clinical Care
*   **Tracking:** Doctors will ask for your cycle history. Use an app or calendar.
*   **Physical Exam:** Pelvic exam to check reproductive organs.
*   **Ultrasound:** To visualize ovaries and uterus (detects cysts, fibroids).
*   **Blood Tests:** To check hormone levels (FSH, LH, Progesterone, Thyroid, Prolactin).

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Heat Therapy:** A hot water bottle on the lower abdomen increases blood flow and relaxes muscles to relieve cramps.
*   **Diet:**
    *   **Iron:** Replenish blood loss with spinach, lentils, red meat, or fortified cereals.
    *   **Magnesium:** Found in bananas and dark chocolate; helps reduce muscle tension.
    *   **Hydration:** Reduces bloating.
*   **Exercise:** Light yoga or walking releases endorphins, natural painkillers.
