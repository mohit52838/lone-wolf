# PMS & PMDD

## Chapter Summary
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is common, but when symptoms become severe enough to disrupt daily functioning, it may be Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). This chapter explores the spectrum of premenstrual disorders, the role of neurotransmitters like serotonin, and effective coping mechanisms.

## Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)
PMS affects over 90% of menstruating women at some point. It is a combination of physical and emotional symptoms that occur in the Luteal phase (1-2 weeks before the period) and resolve once bleeding starts.

### Common Symptoms
*   **Physical:** Bloating, breast tenderness, acne flare-ups, food cravings (especially sweet/salty), fatigue, headaches.
*   **Emotional:** Irritability, mood swings, anxiety, crying spells, poor concentration.

## Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)
PMDD is a severe, chronic medical condition affecting 3-8% of women. It is classified as a depressive disorder in the DSM-5. It is not just "bad PMS"—it is a severe reaction to normal hormonal fluctuations that affects brain chemistry (serotonin).

### Symptoms of PMDD
Symptoms must be present in the final week before the period and improve within a few days of onset.
1.  **Marked Affective Lability:** Sudden sadness, tearfulness, or sensitivity to rejection.
2.  **Marked Irritability/Anger:** Increased interpersonal conflicts.
3.  **Depressed Mood:** Feelings of hopelessness or self-deprecating thoughts.
4.  **Marked Anxiety:** Feeling keyed up, on edge, or tense.
5.  **Physical Symptoms:** Severe lethargy, change in appetite, joint/muscle pain.

> **Self-Check:** If you feel like a "different person" before your period and it affects your work or relationships, track your symptoms for 2 months and see a doctor.

## Management Strategies

### 1. Lifestyle & Diet (For PMS & Mild PMDD)
*   **Diet:**
    *   Reduce salt to minimize bloating.
    *   Limit caffeine and alcohol, which can worsen anxiety and mood swings.
    *   Eat complex carbohydrates (whole grains) to boost serotonin levels.
*   **Exercise:** Aerobic exercise (running, swimming, dancing) releases endorphins and reduces stress.
*   **Sleep:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep. Lack of sleep worsens irritability.

### 2. Supplements (Evidence-Based)
*   **Calcium (1200mg/day):** Shown to reduce physical and emotional symptoms [ACOG].
*   **Magnesium:** Helps with water retention and mood.
*   **Vitamin B6:** May help with mood and energy.

### 3. Medical Treatment (For PMDD)
*   **SSRIs (Antidepressants):** Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (e.g., Fluoxetine, Sertraline) are the first-line treatment for PMDD. They can be taken daily or just during the luteal phase.
*   **Hormonal Birth Control:** Pills containing drospirenone are FDA-approved for PMDD.
*   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Helps develop coping strategies for emotional distress.
