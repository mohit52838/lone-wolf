# Menopause & Perimenopause

## Chapter Summary
Menopause is a natural biological transition, not a disease. It marks the end of menstrual cycles and fertility. This chapter guides you through the stages of menopause, managing symptoms like hot flashes and brain fog, and protecting long-term bone and heart health.

## The Stages of Transition
1.  **Perimenopause:** The years leading up to menopause.
    *   *Timing:* Can start in your 40s (or even late 30s). Lasts 4-8 years.
    *   *What happens:* Ovaries gradually produce less estrogen. Cycles become irregular (shorter, longer, heavier, or lighter).
    *   *Symptoms:* Hot flashes, sleep problems, mood swings, vaginal dryness.
2.  **Menopause:** The point in time when you have not had a menstrual period for **12 consecutive months**.
    *   *Average Age:* 51 (Range: 45-55).
3.  **Postmenopause:** The years after menopause. Symptoms like hot flashes may ease, but health risks related to low estrogen (osteoporosis, heart disease) increase.

## Common Symptoms & Management
### Vasomotor Symptoms (Hot Flashes & Night Sweats)
*   **Triggers:** Spicy food, caffeine, alcohol, stress, warm rooms.
*   **Management:** Dress in layers, keep the bedroom cool, use a portable fan.
*   **Medical:** Hormone Therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment. Non-hormonal options (SSRIs, Gabapentin) exist for those who cannot take hormones.

### Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM)
*   **Symptoms:** Vaginal dryness, itching, pain during sex, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs).
*   **Management:**
    *   *Moisturizers:* Use regularly (every 2-3 days) to maintain tissue health.
    *   *Lubricants:* Use during sexual activity.
    *   *Vaginal Estrogen:* Low-dose creams/tablets that act locally and are safe for most women.

### Mood & Cognition
*   "Brain Fog" and irritability are common due to sleep disruption and hormonal changes. Prioritize sleep hygiene and stress reduction.

## Long-Term Health Risks
### Osteoporosis (Bone Loss)
Estrogen protects bones. After menopause, bone loss accelerates.
*   **Prevention:**
    *   Calcium (1200mg/day) and Vitamin D.
    *   Weight-bearing exercises (walking, dancing, lifting weights).
    *   Bone Density Scan (DEXA) recommended starting at age 65 (or earlier if high risk).

### Cardiovascular Disease
Estrogen helps keep blood vessels flexible. Heart disease risk rises after menopause.
*   **Prevention:** Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Quit smoking.

## Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
HRT replaces the hormones your body stops making.
*   **Benefits:** Relieves hot flashes, prevents bone loss.
*   **Risks:** Slightly increased risk of breast cancer and blood clots (depending on the type, dose, and duration).
*   **Verdict:** For healthy women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, the benefits usually outweigh the risks. **Consult your doctor.**
