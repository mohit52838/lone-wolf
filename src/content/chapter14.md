# Exercise & Movement for Cycle Health

## Chapter Summary
Exercise is not just about fitness; it's a powerful tool for hormonal regulation. This chapter explains how to adapt your workouts to your menstrual cycle (cycle syncing) and the best types of movement for conditions like PCOS.

## Medical Explanation: Exercise & Hormones
Physical activity influences cortisol, insulin, and endorphins.
*   **Benefits:** Improves insulin sensitivity (crucial for PCOS), reduces stress, boosts mood, and supports bone health.
*   **Risks of Overtraining:** Excessive high-intensity exercise can raise cortisol too much, potentially stopping ovulation (hypothalamic amenorrhea).

## Cycle-Syncing Workouts
Tailoring intensity to your energy levels.

1.  **Menstrual Phase (Low Energy):**
    *   **Focus:** Rest and gentle movement.
    *   **Activities:** Yin yoga, walking, stretching.
2.  **Follicular Phase (Rising Energy):**
    *   **Focus:** Try new things, cardio.
    *   **Activities:** Running, dance, hiking, flow yoga.
3.  **Ovulation Phase (Peak Energy):**
    *   **Focus:** High intensity.
    *   **Activities:** HIIT, spin classes, heavy weightlifting.
4.  **Luteal Phase (Winding Down):**
    *   **Focus:** Strength and stability.
    *   **Activities:** Pilates, moderate strength training. As your period nears, switch to lighter activities.

## Exercise for Specific Conditions
*   **PCOS:**
    *   **Best:** Strength training (builds muscle to burn glucose) and steady-state cardio (walking).
    *   **Avoid:** excessive HIIT if it causes burnout/fatigue.
*   **Endometriosis:**
    *   **Best:** Low-impact activities like swimming or yoga to avoid pelvic strain.
*   **Osteoporosis Prevention:** Weight-bearing exercises are essential for bone density.

## Precautions & Home Care
*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you are exhausted, rest. Pushing through fatigue can backfire hormonally.
*   **Fueling:** Eat a mix of protein and carbs after a workout to repair muscle and replenish glycogen.
*   **Consistency:** Regular moderate exercise is better than sporadic intense sessions.
