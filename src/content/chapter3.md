# Endometriosis, Fibroids & Ovarian Cysts

## Chapter Summary
Reproductive health issues like endometriosis and fibroids are often dismissed as "just bad periods," leading to years of delayed diagnosis. This chapter demystifies these conditions, explaining their distinct symptoms, impact on fertility, and modern treatment options ranging from medication to minimally invasive surgery.

## Endometriosis
### What is it?
Endometriosis is a chronic condition where tissue *similar* to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus—on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, or bladder. Like the uterine lining, this tissue thickens, breaks down, and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. However, because it has no way to exit the body, it becomes trapped, causing inflammation, scar tissue (adhesions), and cysts.

### Symptoms
*   **Dysmenorrhea:** Intense pelvic pain before and during periods.
*   **Dyspareunia:** Deep pain during or after intercourse.
*   **Dyschezia:** Painful bowel movements or urination, especially during periods.
*   **Infertility:** Occurs in 30-50% of women with endometriosis.

### Diagnosis & Treatment
*   **Diagnosis:** Laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is the only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis. Ultrasound can detect endometriomas (chocolate cysts).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   *Pain Management:* NSAIDs (Ibuprofen).
    *   *Hormone Therapy:* Birth control pills, Progestins, or GnRH agonists to suppress menstruation and tissue growth.
    *   *Excision Surgery:* Removing the endometrial tissue (Gold Standard).

## Uterine Fibroids (Leiomyomas)
### What are they?
Fibroids are non-cancerous muscular tumors that grow in the wall of the uterus. They are extremely common, affecting up to 70% of women by age 50.

### Symptoms
*   **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding:** Soaking through pads quickly, passing large clots.
*   **Pelvic Pressure:** Feeling of fullness or heaviness in the lower abdomen.
*   **Frequent Urination:** If the fibroid presses on the bladder.
*   **Constipation:** If the fibroid presses on the rectum.

### Treatment
*   **Watchful Waiting:** If symptoms are mild.
*   **Medications:** Tranexamic acid (to reduce bleeding), GnRH agonists (to shrink fibroids temporarily).
*   **Procedures:**
    *   *Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE):* Cutting off blood supply to the fibroid.
    *   *Myomectomy:* Surgical removal of fibroids (preserves fertility).
    *   *Hysterectomy:* Removal of the uterus (definitive cure).

## Ovarian Cysts
### What are they?
Fluid-filled sacs in the ovary. Most are "functional cysts" that form during the normal menstrual cycle and disappear on their own.
*   **Follicular Cyst:** When the follicle doesn't rupture to release the egg.
*   **Corpus Luteum Cyst:** When the follicle seals up after releasing the egg and fluid builds up.

### When to Worry (Ovarian Torsion/Rupture)
Seek emergency care if you experience:
*   Sudden, severe abdominal pain (often on one side).
*   Pain accompanied by fever and vomiting.
*   Faintness or dizziness.
