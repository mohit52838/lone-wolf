# Sexual & Reproductive Health

## Chapter Summary
Sexual health is a fundamental part of overall well-being. It involves safe sexual experiences, freedom from coercion, and access to contraception and healthcare. This chapter covers contraception methods, STI prevention, and the importance of consent and communication.

## Contraception: Knowing Your Options
There is no "best" method; the right choice depends on your lifestyle, health, and future plans.

### 1. Barrier Methods
*   **Male/Female Condoms:** The **ONLY** method that protects against both pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).
*   **Diaphragm/Cervical Cap:** Used with spermicide.

### 2. Hormonal Methods (Short-Acting)
*   **The Pill (OCP):** Taken daily. Highly effective if taken perfectly.
*   **The Patch:** Changed weekly.
*   **Vaginal Ring:** Changed monthly.
*   **Injection (Depo-Provera):** Given every 3 months.

### 3. Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC)
*   **IUD (Intrauterine Device):**
    *   *Copper IUD:* Hormone-free, lasts up to 10-12 years. Can cause heavier periods.
    *   *Hormonal IUD (Mirena/Kyleena):* Lasts 3-7 years. Often makes periods lighter or stops them.
*   **Implant:** A small rod placed in the arm. Lasts up to 3 years.

### 4. Emergency Contraception
*   **The "Morning-After Pill":** Should be taken as soon as possible (within 72 hours) after unprotected sex. It delays ovulation. It is **not** an abortion pill and will not work if you are already pregnant.

## Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Many STIs are asymptomatic, meaning you can have one without knowing it.

*   **Chlamydia & Gonorrhea:** Bacterial. Can cause Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and infertility if untreated. Cured with antibiotics.
*   **Syphilis:** Bacterial. Can cause serious long-term damage. Cured with penicillin.
*   **Herpes (HSV):** Viral. Causes painful blisters. No cure, but antivirals manage outbreaks.
*   **HPV (Human Papillomavirus):** Viral. Certain strains cause genital warts; others cause cervical cancer. **Prevention:** HPV Vaccine (Gardasil 9).
*   **HIV:** Viral. Attacks the immune system. Managed with Antiretroviral Therapy (ART).

> **Recommendation:** Get tested annually if you are sexually active, or with every new partner.

## Consent & Communication
*   **Consent must be:**
    *   *Enthusiastic:* "Yes!" not just silence.
    *   *Revocable:* You can change your mind at any time.
    *   *Informed:* Knowing about STIs or contraception use.
    *   *Specific:* Saying yes to one act doesn't mean yes to others.
*   **Communication:** Discuss sexual history and contraception *before* things get heated. It's a sign of maturity and respect.
