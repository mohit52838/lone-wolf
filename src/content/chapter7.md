# Lifestyle & Self-care

## Chapter Summary
True health is holistic—it encompasses physical, mental, and emotional well-being. This chapter provides actionable advice on nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress management tailored specifically for women's physiology.

## Nutrition: Fueling Your Body
Women have unique nutritional needs that change throughout life.

*   **Iron:** Women lose iron during menstruation. Deficiency leads to anemia (fatigue, pale skin).
    *   *Sources:* Red meat, spinach, lentils, fortified cereals. Pair with Vitamin C (citrus) for better absorption.
*   **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Critical for bone density, especially to prevent osteoporosis later in life.
    *   *Sources:* Dairy products, almonds, leafy greens, sunlight (Vitamin D).
*   **Folic Acid:** Essential for reproductive health and preventing birth defects.
    *   *Sources:* Dark leafy greens, beans, peas, nuts.
*   **Hydration:** Drink at least 2-3 liters of water daily. It helps with digestion, skin health, and reducing bloating.

## Exercise: Movement as Medicine
Aim for at least **150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity** or **75 minutes of vigorous activity** per week.

### Types of Exercise
1.  **Cardio (Aerobic):** Walking, running, swimming, dancing. Improves heart health and mood.
2.  **Strength Training:** Lifting weights or bodyweight exercises. Crucial for building bone density and metabolism.
3.  **Flexibility & Balance:** Yoga and Pilates. Reduces stress and prevents falls in older age.
4.  **Kegel Exercises:** Strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the uterus and bladder. Helpful for preventing incontinence and improving sexual health.

## Sleep Hygiene
Sleep is when the body repairs itself. Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts hormones (cortisol, ghrelin, leptin), leading to weight gain and mood disorders.
*   **Routine:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time.
*   **Environment:** Keep the room cool, dark, and quiet.
*   **Digital Detox:** Avoid screens 1 hour before bed (blue light suppresses melatonin).

## Stress Management
Chronic stress keeps cortisol levels high, which can disrupt the menstrual cycle and suppress the immune system.
*   **Mindfulness:** Meditation, deep breathing exercises.
*   **Boundaries:** Learn to say "no" to overcommitment.
*   **Connection:** Spend time with supportive friends and family.

## Preventive Screenings Checklist
*   **Pap Smear:** Every 3 years (ages 21-29) or co-testing with HPV every 5 years (ages 30-65).
*   **Mammogram:** Annual or biennial starting at age 40-50 (discuss with doctor).
*   **Blood Pressure:** At least every 2 years.
*   **Cholesterol & Diabetes:** Regular screening starting at age 45 (or earlier if risk factors exist).
*   **Skin Check:** Annual check for suspicious moles.
