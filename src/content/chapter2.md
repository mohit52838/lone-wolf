# PCOD & PCOS

## Chapter Summary
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders affecting women of reproductive age. It is a complex metabolic and hormonal condition that goes beyond just "cysts on ovaries." This chapter clarifies the difference between PCOD and PCOS, explores the root causes (insulin resistance, inflammation), and outlines evidence-based management strategies.

## Medical Explanation
### PCOD vs. PCOS
*   **PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease):** Often considered a milder variant. The ovaries produce many immature eggs that partially mature but don't release, forming cysts. It is largely managed by diet and lifestyle.
*   **PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome):** A more severe metabolic disorder. It involves high levels of androgens (male hormones) and is often linked to systemic issues like insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease risk.

### The Mechanism
In PCOS, the pituitary gland may release high levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), disrupting the menstrual cycle. Simultaneously, the body may be resistant to insulin, causing the pancreas to pump out more insulin. High insulin triggers the ovaries to produce more testosterone, preventing ovulation and causing symptoms like acne and hair growth.

## Symptoms
PCOS presents differently in every woman. The "Rotterdam Criteria" requires 2 of the following 3 for diagnosis:
1.  **Irregular Periods (Oligo-ovulation):** Fewer than 9 periods a year.
2.  **Hyperandrogenism:** High levels of male hormones, showing as:
    *   *Hirsutism:* Excess hair on face, chest, back.
    *   *Acne:* Cystic acne, especially along the jawline.
    *   *Alopecia:* Male-pattern hair thinning.
3.  **Polycystic Ovaries:** Enlarged ovaries with multiple small follicles (seen on ultrasound).

> **Note:** You can have PCOS *without* having cysts on your ovaries.

## Diagnosis
*   **Medical History:** Checking menstrual regularity and family history.
*   **Blood Tests:**
    *   Testosterone (Total and Free)
    *   FSH and LH ratio
    *   Fasting Insulin and Glucose (HOMA-IR)
    *   Lipid Profile
*   **Pelvic Ultrasound:** To look for the "string of pearls" appearance of follicles.

## Management & Treatment
There is no cure for PCOS, but it is highly manageable.

### 1. Lifestyle Modifications (First-Line Treatment)
*   **Weight Management:** Losing 5-10% of body weight can restore ovulation and improve insulin sensitivity [ESHRE, 2018].
*   **Diet:**
    *   *Low Glycemic Index (GI):* Choose complex carbs (whole grains, veggies) over refined sugars to prevent insulin spikes.
    *   *Anti-inflammatory:* Omega-3 rich foods (walnuts, flaxseeds, fatty fish).
*   **Exercise:** A mix of cardio and strength training improves insulin sensitivity.

### 2. Medical Interventions
*   **Hormonal Birth Control:** Regulates periods and lowers androgen levels (reduces acne/hair growth).
*   **Metformin:** An anti-diabetic drug used off-label to improve insulin resistance and help with ovulation.
*   **Anti-androgens (e.g., Spironolactone):** Specifically targets hair growth and acne.
*   **Fertility Treatments:** Clomiphene or Letrozole to induce ovulation if trying to conceive.

## Precautions & Long-term Health
Women with PCOS have a higher risk of:
*   Type 2 Diabetes
*   High Blood Pressure & Cholesterol
*   Endometrial Cancer (due to infrequent shedding of the uterine lining)
*   Sleep Apnea

**Regular screening** for diabetes and cholesterol is essential.
